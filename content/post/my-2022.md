So as I’m writing this today, its 4th of Jan 2022.  
2021 has been a eventful year for me and everyone else around the world.
We are in second year of Covid, a bad year at that, but somehow we’ve survived and come through.

Personally, 2021 was good for me as I got to spend more time with family, likewise be with my friends.
As I turned 30 this year,it kinda made be realize how far I am from my life goals. 
One major pain-point was my financial situation. I made a decision take out a loan for personal reaons a few years back. And in that few years I had not really put a dent on it. 

I came to a major realization after reading ‘Psychology of Money`([link](https://www.amazon.in/Psychology-Money-Morgan-Housel/dp/9390166268/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?adgrpid=58360763029&ext_vrnc=hi&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_c-OBhDFARIsAIFg3ez0YUv81ZBebp_bXwGSpnYwz7YIcACCP-V3tYHxlfPgKzh4gp6vR_8aAr2IEALw_wcB&hvadid=294140223746&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1007772&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=1484304132590792612&hvtargid=kwd-299528520470&hydadcr=23635_1725031&keywords=psychology+of+money&qid=1641351812&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE2RlhFSUhCUk43VkImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA2MzI2ODIzREFQQkNRRkdLSEVaJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNDUxNTgzQjgySzVVM1k5VVdIJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==)). This book made me realize making money is not just about trying to get promoted or working for a big company and drawing a high salary, but instead is also about saving and investing. I had allowed lifestyle inflation to go unchecked no salary was enough.

I remember when read this book in October how naive I was about money. I realized if anyone asked me where my money went and why I was broke at the end of month I could not answer.

So just before my bithday, I decided to fix this. I built a template in Notion([link](https://chiragsp.dev/post/personal-finance/)) and diligently started tracking my expenses. Setup automatic monthly saving systems, and vowed to budget at the start of every month. I am happy to report I'm happily budgeting away ever since.

Coming to the professional side of my life, I work as a Software Engineer at a large Product Company focusing on enterprise software.
In the past year, specifically during the end of 2020, my resonsibilities had increased as I was asked to lead a team. This was a new opputunity and I had jumped on the offer.

This was difficult to manage initially but slowly but surely I was able to cope. I'm grateful to my collegues and company for having given this oppurtunity. Even though it was tough, I learnt a lot, especially, about Front-end development and also about people, how to manage everyone's expectation. 

Even though it was a great year, consisting personal and professional growth, it did leave me a bit burned out. It made be question about where my life was headed. I was eager to start working on my lifelong dream of doing something of my own.

Coming to 2022, I known I've always loved to create new things. That’s why I jump onto opportunities to build products in the first place, in areas which I have no clue about. 

Recently, I came across an awesome blog `tinyprojects.com`([link](https://tinyprojects.dev/)). And this got me completely inspired to start creating tiny projects myself and start selling. So this is what I’ve decided to do in 2022,

> Build and Deploy 12 tiny projects in 2022
> 

My main conditions for this project are,

1. Build 1 product every month
2. Release it to the public for users to try 
3. Add monetization feature for each app
4. Use Twitter, Reditt and Product Hunt to market the products

So with this in mind, I’ve started building my first tiny project i.e [SQLGrammar](https://sqlgrammar.com). 
Hope I have something to show at the end of the month.

So summarize, my main goal for 2022 is earn atleast 1 dollar outside my day job. Thats it.
