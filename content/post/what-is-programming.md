What is programming ? How best can you compare programming with. It may look so complex and out of reach at first glance, but all it really is a set of instructions. Do this first and do that later, thats all. If you want to convey a set of instructions to another person, how would you do that. By using some language of course, like English, French or something else.

Programming languages are nothing but these different languagea that a machine can understand and then carry out these instructions. While a person might get some instruction and maybe not follow it to the T, a machine will always carry out the instruction exactly as instructed(as far its not limited by processing or memory).

Just to give you a brief on how programming started, initially `Punch cards` as show below were used.

Using Punch Cards, 0s and 1s could be stored. 
But what is 0 and 1 in world of an electronic device? 0 is when current does not flow, and 1 is when current flows. So basically its a ON and OFF switch. its kinda weird isn't it ? all that a computer can understand is ON and OFF and still we are able program it to do so many complex things. 

So now the next questiion that you might ask is , how does memory storage works in a computer system. There are many complex algorithms and such, basically it boils down to the concept of gates. 

Basically Gates are electrical circuits and using different combination , we can sure of the output based of what input we pass to the circuits. Explaining about of gates would put me in pretty much another tangent, so just to summarize, computer is nothing but combination of switches and and you pass current or do not pass current and that makes it basically tick.

So now coming back to programming languages, where do they fit in to the whole 1s and 0s arc. We can't basically write so many 0s and 1s for everything that we want something to be done. Also it would be very difficult to memorize as well. Imagine we want to add two numbers, doing that would involve so many combination of 0s and 1s. Wouldn't be nice if you had intermediary to translate a low level language to 0s and 1s. 

This is were micro-controller/microprocessor languages come in.

Micro-controller/microprocessor are basically lots of circuits that can do complex task. 

So if 0s and 1s was the first layer, micro-controller/microprocessor languages are the second layer. To make it even easier, OS like Microsoft 10/ Mac OS have a another layer of programming language on top of it. After this comes your well-know languages like Python, Java, C++ and others. 

You can use these languages to basically run some computations, and these languages are used  by the OS to convert to machine language that can be understood by the micro-controller/microprocessor. 

As a basic introduction to Programming I will start with Python. Python being one of the most used languages is also very easy to learn. It very readable and easy to understand.

 Head over to the next article to get an intro to Python programming language.
