Human mind is complex machine , it can do so many things so well, but the area where it lacks is definitely perfect recall. Though it looks cool in movies when the main character is able to remember the situation exactly, in real life its much more muckier.

Sometimes it gets so bad that what we think we remember ,might be the exact opposite of what might have transpired. Hopefully that has inspired to start diligently taking notes of things important to you in your day-today life, especially in your profession life.   

So what is best note taking app you ask. Well, answer might not so straight forward. There are quite good ones like Evernote and Roam Research (which I hear is excellent).

But for me personally I wanted a simple note-taking plus MS word type functionality app. For that i think Notion is excellent. 

So you can get Notion at below location,

[Notion - The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.](https://www.notion.so/)

You can use it online or an Mac/Windows app. The best thing about it is that, they have feature based subscription model. And for initial personal use , it completely free! 

So why don't download and start exploring. I can maybe elaborate on some additional features of Notion in another blog.

Some screenshots of my personal Notion app
