The work on this tool was done during my tenure in Subex private limited. Subex is basically telecom software coming. They have many tools to calculate revenue for telecom companies based on thier CDR (call data records).
This tool was one such tool build modified specially for British Telecom. The core application of Subex being 'Partner Settlement'. On top of this code , we build additional features for British Telecom to use. 

This product was called UKNG. The client side was build using DotNet and backend was build using Java.

This was a stable application, my work mainly involved adding minor changes for UKNG backend application , like saving an additional field.
Also I worked on client side DotNet application. This involved adding a text field or button and mapping it to a function.
