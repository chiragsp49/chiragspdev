Basically Siebel is a customer management tool provided by Oracle.  It has GUI part handled by agents and Siebel Tools part used by Siebel developers to change or add new features to Siebel CRM.

During my association with Accenture, I was mainly working on this maintaining Siebel CRM for their Clients.

My job involved managing and developing the applications. Like adding a new Screen or adding a new button to a existing screen.
