Subex has a product for partner settlement for telecom operators called 'Partner Settlement(PS)'. GSPS is a version of PS build specially for British Telecom.

My work involved resolving multiple deadlock issues. This involved thorough debugging of the application.

Also I was involved in upgrading the application from GSPS 1.0 to GSPS 2.0. This involved adding additional features and supporting additional CDR analysis support for different countries.
