The players are dealt the cards and aim of the game is clear your desk. This was a complex game to code as it involved lot of game logic that I needed to consider. Like for example,

1. A logic to keep track of the cards in play
2. Logic to keep track of each players remaining cards,
3. Needed to keep track who had play next and 
4. Also needed to check the winning condition.
