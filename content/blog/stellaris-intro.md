Ever wondered how it it feel to control a multi-stellar empire. How amazing it would be to interact with completely alien species(completely alien, not some human looking alien, well maybe not).

Then Stellaris is the game for you.

Ever since my Age of Empire , EU4 playing days, I always wished there existed a huge space faring version of this , with all the different planets, alien empires, politics and ships. To be fare, there were some like for example 'Master of Orion' , Sins of the solar empire , Sword of the Stars.

For me Sword of Stars came close , but they completely recked a great game by making Sword of the Stars 2.

So when Paradox Studios announced 'Stellaris', I was excited. And boy oh boy! they didn't disappoint.

If you ever played Age of Empires , you'll get the idea. Stellaris is similar to it , but in a much grander scale. It takes place in our galaxy( galaxy size can range from 50 stars to 1000 stars), containing dozens of other alien empires. There are also primitive empires(ones which have not achieve space), you can choose to conquer, study or maybe uplift them as well.

In Stellaris your main aim to technologically advance , colonize new planets and if required conquer other empires.

Unlike other games u don't arbitrarily control territory like a sphere of influence around you star system , you need to build outposts in each star system and only then be able to extract resources from it.

I missed telling you the best part about Stellaris , i.e Exploration. Exploration in Stellaris is so similar to Star-trek. You boldly go to unexplored corners of the galaxy. You need survey a new system, research anomalies and research artifacts.

So to end this short article, Stellaris is dream game for Science fiction and Strategy games enthusiast. Do check it out find out yourself how awesome this game is.
