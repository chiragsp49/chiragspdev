In our day-to-day lives we have plenty of distractions. With the advent of every new technology , the number of distractions keep increasing.

But at the end of the day, the work that needs to be done has to be done.

Increasing pressure at work, and the proliferation of the hustle culture, just adds to the pressure. So it becomes harder and harder to do good productive work.

The best work one can achieve is by being in a state of complete focus called the `flow` state.

This is almost like a trance like meditation. This flow state once achieved, can allow one to work continuously with amazing results.

One famous technique to achieving this flow state is the `POMODORO` technique.

`Pomodoro` technique is working in chunks of focused time. For example you plan on writing an article or building a website. You don't say you'll work for 4 hours today and complete it. But instead you'll work four 25 mins chunks with 5 mins break in between. This 25 mins will be timed and you don't allow any distractions to come in between.

Why in fact I'm writing this article in this way. This technique especially works wonders for creative work.

You don't have to do all your task in one go. You can spread out your work through out the day or week and do complete 25 minutess of focused work. This way you can chunk several different work together in a single day.

Only thing to keep in mind is be completely focused on your task for 25 mins. 

Another tip for focusing is to listen to `lofi` music.  `Lofi` music helps you put in the zone.

Finally, I would like to end this article with a nice quote I came across recently,
